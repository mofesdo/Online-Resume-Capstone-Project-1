    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I've had many hobbies over the years but here are some of my most recent</p>
    <h2>Gaming / Streaming</h2>

    <p>I've been playing video games since I was  3yrs old. I went to college to learn how to create video games and I've made so many friends through gaming that it will always be a part of me. I like to stream to friends and family but I built a small fan base by helping guide others in the games I play.</p>
    <h2>Gym</h2>

    <p>Over the past year and a half I've been going to the gym regularly. Initially I wanted to lose a lot of weight but now I've fallen in love with the process of working out and want to not just lose weight but overall live a healthier life.</p>
